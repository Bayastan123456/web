          We believe that travel is for everyone. It helps us learn about
          ourselves and the world around us.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our goal is to help more people from more backgrounds experience the
          joy of exploration. Because we believe this builds a kinder, more
          inclusive, more open-minded world.
          <br />
          <br />
          Like you, travel is in our DNA. At Lonely Planet, we believe travel
          opens the door to the greatest, most unforgettable experiences life
          can offer. And we have learned that the best travel is about putting
          yourself out there, about leaving behind the everyday, about immersing
          yourself, rather than just seeing the sights.
          <br />
          <br />
          As travelers, you're on a journey, and at Lonely Planet, we're on one,
          too. Over the last two years, travel has transformed. We're thinking
          deeply not just about how we travel but why we travel and how to best
          serve travelers on their journey â€“ and we approach our 50th year with
          a passion and commitment to helping others do it, too.
